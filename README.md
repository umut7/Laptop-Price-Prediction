# Laptop Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to develop a predictive model using `RandomForestRegressor` to estimate the price of a laptop based on its specifications. The project also includes exploratory data analysis to understand correlations between different laptop specifications and the price.

## Technologies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Feature Engineering**
   
2. **Data Transformation**
   
3. **Data Scaling**

## Model Training Steps

1. **Feature Selection**

2. **Model Training**

3. **Prediction and Visualization**

## Results

- The model achieved an acceptable score, indicating its ability to generalize and predict laptop prices reasonably well.
- The feature correlations highlight which specifications have the most impact on laptop prices, which can be useful for analysis and business insights.
